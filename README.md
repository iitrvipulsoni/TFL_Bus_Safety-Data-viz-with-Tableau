# London Bus Incidents and Safety Measures
This project uses Tableau to visualize and analyze the London bus incidents and safety measures dataset, which contains information on incidents that occurred on London buses from January 2015 to September 2018, as well as the safety measures that were in place at the time of each incident.

The goal of this project is to understand trends and patterns in bus incidents in London, and to identify opportunities for improving bus safety. The visualization includes interactive dashboards and charts that allow users to explore the data and gain insights on the frequency and types of incidents, the factors that may contribute to incidents, and the effectiveness of safety measures.

To view the visualization, open the Tableau workbook https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vipul.soni/viz/TFL_Bus_Safety-DatavizwithTableau/LondonBusSafetyJanuary2015toSeptember2018 using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public. 

The dataset is included in the repository, so no additional setup is required.
